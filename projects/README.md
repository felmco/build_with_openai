# 🛠️ Practical Projects

Welcome to the **Projects Module**! This section is designed to help you strictly apply what you've learned in the previous modules by building complete, real-world applications.

Each project is structured as a **step-by-step tutorial**, teaching you not just *what* code to write, but *why* we're writing it and *how* to think about the architecture.

## 📂 Project List

### [1. Auto Researcher Agent](./01-auto-researcher/README.md)
**Level**: Intermediate
**Tech**: `o1-mini` (Reasoning), Agents SDK, Function Calling
**Goal**: Build an autonomous agent that can research a broad topic, break it down into sub-questions, and compile a comprehensive summary report.
**What you'll learn**:
- How to implement agentic reasoning loops.
- Managing long-running tasks.
- Structuring complex outputs.

### [2. Vision Sales Assistant](./02-vision-assistant/README.md)
**Level**: Beginner-Intermediate
**Tech**: `gpt-4o` (Vision), Structured Outputs
**Goal**: Create a tool that analyzes product photos and automatically generates SEO-friendly descriptions, social media captions, and pricing estimates.
**What you'll learn**:
- processing images with GPT-4o.
- Extracting structured data from visual inputs.
- Generating multi-channel content.

### [3. Voice Ops Commander](./03-voice-commander/README.md)
**Level**: Advanced
**Tech**: Whisper (ASR), TTS-1 (Audio), Realtime API concepts
**Goal**: Build a voice-controlled interface for your computer that can listen to commands, execute system scripts, and speak back the results.
**What you'll learn**:
- Handling audio input/output.
- Building voice-to-action pipelines.
- Creating a natural conversational interface.

## 🚀 How to Approaches These Projects

1.  **Read the Guide**: Start by reading the `README.md` in each project folder. It explains the architecture and logic.
2.  **Code Along**: Don't just run the final file. Create a new file (e.g., `my_agent.py`) and build it section by section following the guide.
3.  **Experiment**: Once it works, try changing the prompts, models, or adding new features suggested in the "Next Steps" section.
